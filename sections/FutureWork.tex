\section{Future Work}

Through the nature of SINATRA it is expected for there to be a large amount of future work. This code base is not a new concept in the world of DSMC and PIC or even DSMC-PIC. The important part about this is that it will be developed further to a point where Cal Poly has a homegrown code which is state of the art and can help develop new Aerospace technology.
