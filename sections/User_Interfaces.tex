sinatra is not built for error management
\subsection{Graphical User Interface}
The main goal of SINATRA is to be able to simulate rarefied gas for research purposes. It is aimed for use by Faculty, Graduate Students, and specialized Clubs in focused research and projects. However, a DSMC-PIC simulation is a useful tool for even undergraduate classes to test and work with. With that purpose in mind, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for SINATRA has been created. This GUI is built using MATLAB's Guide tool. It allows a user who has never seen the source code to be able to set up and run simulations. It is built with the expectation that the user does not know how to set up a SINATRA run. \par
The GUI allows the user to input the various parameters of a SINATRA run. It does low level error checking on their input to help the user make simulations without many errors. Then the user can create an input text file through a click of a button. The simulation converts the user's inputs into the format of Sinatra's input file. Then the user can select 'Run' and the GUI will takes a current distribution of SINATRA's executable and run it with the recently created input file.
