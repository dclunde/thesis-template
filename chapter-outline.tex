\chapter{Systems Engineering}
\label{chap:systems}
All large aerospace projects can be viewed a group of integrated systems. The systems must be designed and managed in order to provide a reliable and efficient final product. Systems Engineering is the discipline which covers this area. SINATRA is a complex project and program which needs a smooth integration of the various program and sub-systems. This chapter will explain the various systems engineering implementations in SINATRA including documentation, work-flow, and user interfaces.

\chapter{Charged Particles}
A DSMC simulation has many applications in aerospace engineering. However, it does not capture the full picture when gasses are composed of ions and electrons. Plasma, which is composes of charged particles, needs the electrostatics to be taken into account in the simulation in order to create an accurate model. This chapter will explain how to simulate charged particles with the particle in cell method, how that method was implemented in SINATRA, and validation of the implementation.
