abstract = {Electric propulsion thrusters are replacing small chemical thrusters used for spacecraft control and orbital maneuvers. These thrusters use a variety of mechanisms to convert electrical power into thrust and in general provide superior specific impulse in comparison to chemical systems. Electric propulsion has been under development for the last fifty years, and almost all thrusters are designed based largely on experience and experimentation. The present article considers the progress made in numerical simulation of electric propulsion thrusters. Due to the wide range of such devices, attention is restricted to electric propulsion thruster types that are presently in use by orbiting spacecraft. The physical regimes created in these thrusters indicate that a variety of numerical methods are required for accurate numerical simulation ranging from continuum formulations to kinetic approaches. Successes of numerical simulation models are demonstrated through specific examples. It is concluded that numerical simulations can be expected to play a more prominent role in the design and evolution of future electric propulsion thrusters.},

abstract = {In previous sections we have been been concerned with time dependent initial value problems where we start with some assumed initial condition, calculate how this solution will change in time and then simply march through time updating as we go. We have considered both explicit and implicit schemes, but the basic point is that given a starting place it's relatively straightforward to get to the next step. The principal difficulty with time dependent schemes is stability and accuracy (they're not the same thing), i.e. how to march through time without blowing up and arriving at a future time with most of your intended physics intact. Boundary value problems, are a somewhat different animal. In a boundary value problem we are trying to satisfy a steady state solution everywhere in space that agrees with our prescribed boundary conditions. For a flux conservative problem , the problem becomes finding the set of fluxes at all the nodes such that for every node, what comes in goes out. In general, boundary value problems will reduce, when discretized, to a large and sparse set of linear (and sometimes non-linear) equations. While stability is no longer a problem, efficiency in solving these equations becomes tantamount. The following sections will first develop some physical intuition into the types and sources of boundary value problems, then show how to discretize them and finally present a potpourri of solution techniques. 9.1 Where BVP's come from: basic physics Many Boundary value problems arise from steady state solutions of transient problems (or from implicit schemes in transient problems). For example if we were considering the general transient heat flow problem for diffusion plus a source 139},

abstract = {The COLISEUM framework is a tool designed for electric propulsion plume interactions. Virginia Tech has been developing a module for COLISEUM called DRACO, a particle-in-cell based code capable of plume modeling for geometrically complex spacecraft. This work integrates a charging module into DRACO. Charge is collected via particle impingement on the spacecraft surface and converted to potential. Charge can be stored in the surface, or added to a local ground potential. Current can flow through the surface and is governed by the internal electric field in the spacecraft. Several test cases were run to demonstrate the code's capabilities. The first was a plume impingement of a composite spherical probe by a xenon thruster. It was shown that the majority of current conducted will reach the interior of the spacecraft, not other surface elements. A conductive interior will therefore result in a uniform surface potential, even for low surface conductivities. A second test case showed a composite spacecraft exposed to a solar wind. This test showed that when a potential gradient is applied to a conductive body, the ground potential of the spacecraft will lower significantly to compensate and maintain a zero net current. The case that used the semiconductive material showed that the effect of the potential gradient can be lowered in cases such as this, where some charge will always be stuck in the surface. If a dielectric material is used, the gradient will disappear altogether. The final test case showed the effect of charge exchange ion back-flow on the potential of a spacecraft similar to the DAWN spacecraft. This case showed that CEX ion distribution is not even along the spacecraft and will result in a transverse potential gradient along the panel.},

abstract = {Although several operational codes are available for the prediction of plume dynamics of Hall thrusters and their interactions with spacecraft surfaces, their coverage of the range of physical phenomena involved and their ability to model complex geometries and material combinations has tended to be fairly restricted. We have initiated the development of a more comprehensive suite of models intended to be used either on their own, or as modules in an overall architecture of the type recently initiated at the Air Force Research Laboratory (Fife, et al. [1]). As a first stage in this development, the simplified physics currently embodied in an existing plume code (D. Oh, 1997 [2]) has been implemented in a new unstructured tetrahedral grid designed to couple with the surface grids generated by the AFRL for realistic representation of a typical spacecraft. A detailed source model that includes separate distributions for single and double ions as well as different populations has been integrated. More refinements on sputtering and material deposition and a method for predicting plasma behavior in non-quasineutral regions are planned, but have not yet been incorporated. The code models Xenon ions, double ions and neutrals kinetically, whereas the electrons are modeled as a fluid continuum. Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) techniques are used to simulate the important collisions between kinetically modeled particles. Preliminary results presented here are compared to laboratory measurements on the plume of a low-power thruster.},

abstract = {Discretizing the elliptic Poisson equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions by the finite difference method results in a system of linear equations with a large, sparse, highly structured system matrix. It is a classical test problem for comparing the performance of direct and iterative linear solvers. We compare in this report Gaussian elimination applied to a dense system matrix, Gaussian elimination applied to a sparse system matrix, the classical iterative methods of Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and SOR, and finally, the conjugate gradient method without preconditioning, and the conjugate gradient method with SSOR preconditioning. The key conclusions are: (i) The comparison of dense and sparse storage shows the crucial importance of sparse storage mode to solve problems even of intermediate size. (ii) The conjugate gradient method outperforms the classical iterative methods in all cases. (iii) Preconditioning can speed up the conjugate gradient method by an order of magnitude. (iv) We find that in two dimensions Gaussian elimination of a sparse system matrix is the fastest method, but runs out of memory eventually, where iterative methods can still solve the problem, but at the price of possibly extremely long run times. (v) However, in three dimensions, the iterative methods can be significantly faster than Gaussian elimination and can solve significantly larger problems. This explains the importance of iterative methods for three-dimensional problems.},

abstract = {The DSMC Analysis Code (DAC) software represents the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA'S) state-of-the-art implementation of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method of Bird for simulating three-dimensional flows. It is utilized by NASA, as well as other organizations from the government, commercial and academic sectors to simulate rarefied gas dynamic environments with complex geometric or flowfield characteristics. The fundamentals of the DSMC method are presented to provide the necessary groundwork for a discussion of the important features of the DAC software. The accuracy of the implementation is demonstrated through a collection of previously documented results, where simulations performed using the DAC software are compared to other codes as well as actual flight derived data. A compilation of diverse applications is used to highlight the software's underlying flexibility and the significance of this capability to support important NASA missions. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.
